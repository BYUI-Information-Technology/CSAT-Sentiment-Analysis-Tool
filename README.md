## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port already in use**

```bash
# Solution: The app now uses port 5001 by default
# If port 5001 is also in use, modify port in app.py: app.run(port=5002)
# On macOS, port 5000 is used by AirPlay Receiver service
```

**Model download fails**

```bash
# Solution: Check internet connection
# Restart application - model will retry download
```

**Excel file not recognized**

```bash
# Solution: Upload any Excel file (.xlsx or .xls)
# Use the preview to select which column contains text
# Verify file isn't corrupted
```

**Memory errors with large files**

```bash
# Solution: Split large files into smaller chunks
# Recommend <10,000 responses per file
```

### Performance Tips

- üí° **Smaller files process faster** - Consider splitting large datasets
- üí° **First run slower** - AI model downloads on initial use
- üí° **Close other applications** - Free up RAM for better performance
- üí° **SSD storage recommended** - Faster file I/O operations
